# PokéBook

Fun while it lasted, however, I am no longer maintaining PokéBook and it has been removed from deployment.

## Motivation

PokéBook is a non-commercial project for use in my personal portfolio.\
The project's primary function is to showcase my proficiency with the technologies used within.

## Technologies Used

* Typescript
* React
* Material-UI
* GraphQL

## Features

PokéBook is a searchable pokédex featuring the original 150 pokémon.
