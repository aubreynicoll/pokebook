## Motivation

PokéBook is a non-commercial project for use in my personal portfolio.\
The project's primary function is to showcase my proficiency with the technologies used within.

## Technologies Utilized

* Typescript
* React
* Material-UI
* GraphQL
* And more on the way...

## Features

PokéBook is a work-in-progress.\
My first target is to develop a working Pokédex that includes the original 150 Pokémon.\
Later, I plan on adding authentication and user profiles.
