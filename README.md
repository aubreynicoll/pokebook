# PokéBook

The Unofficial Pokémon-Themed Social Media Network

## Motivation

PokéBook is a non-commercial project for use in my personal portfolio.\
The project's primary function is to showcase my proficiency with the technologies utilized within.

## Technologies Utilized

* Typescript
* React
* And more on the way...

## Features

PokéBook is a work-in-progress.\
My first target is to develop a working Pokédex that includes the original 150 Pokémon.\
Later, I plan on adding authentication and user profiles.

## How to Use

A local instance of PokéBook would be started by running the following commands:
1. `git clone https://github.com/aubreynicoll/pokebook-frontend`
2. `cd pokebook-frontend`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`

However, this assumes you are running a local instance of the server.\
In the future, I will be pushing PokéBook to Heroku for demo purposes. I'll be sure to add a link when I do!
